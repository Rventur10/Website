## About

> Hi, I’m a senior at Bowling Green State University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. With a passion for solving complex problems, I primarily focus on Python and C++, continually expanding my skills and knowledge in these languages and other languages. As I approach graduation, I’m eager to participate real-world projects and contribute to innovative solutions along side other like-minded individuals. Whether it's building efficient algorithms or developing user-friendly applications, I’m always excited to learn and grow as a developer.
